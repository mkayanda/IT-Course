Week 1 Notes: Foundations of IT & Project Workflow
These notes cover the introductory concepts from the first week of the "Techworld with Nana: IT Beginners Course," focusing on the course structure, the software development lifecycle, and project management fundamentals with Agile, Scrum, and Jira.

Day 1: Introduction to the Course (August 8, 2025)
Key Takeaways:
Course Goal: To provide a comprehensive understanding of the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) from the perspective of different roles (Developer, Tester, SysAdmin). This is a practical, hands-on course, not just theoretical.

Structure: The course simulates a real-world project where you build and deploy a full-stack application called "Teamable."

Core Technologies Covered:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js

Backend: Node.js

Database: MongoDB

Testing: Jest

Deployment: Linux, Cloud Servers (DigitalOcean)

Collaboration: Git, Jira

Accessing Resources:

Course materials, including video lectures and handouts, are available on the Teachable platform.

A dedicated Slack or Discord channel is provided for student collaboration and asking questions. It's crucial to join this community.

All code for the "Teamable" project will be provided, but it is highly recommended to code along to maximize learning.

Administrative FAQs:

The course is self-paced. The provided study plan is a recommendation.

A certificate of completion is available upon finishing the course.

Lifetime access is granted to all course materials.

Day 2: Introduction to Software Development Workflow (August 9, 2025)
1. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The SDLC is a structured process that outlines the stages involved in creating and maintaining software. It ensures a high-quality product that meets customer expectations.

Typical Stages:

Planning & Requirement Analysis: Define the project goals, scope, and requirements. What problem are we solving?

Design: Create the system architecture and design specifications. This includes UI/UX design, database schema, and system component design.

Development (Implementation): Write the actual code based on the design documents. This is the longest phase.

Testing: Verify that the software is bug-free and meets all requirements. This includes various types of testing (unit, integration, system, etc.).

Deployment: Release the software to a production environment where users can access it.

Maintenance: Provide ongoing support, bug fixes, and enhancements after the release.

2. What is Agile and Scrum?
Agile is a modern philosophy or mindset for software development that prioritizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative progress. It's a response to the limitations of traditional, rigid models like the Waterfall method.

Core Principles of Agile (from the Agile Manifesto):

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

Working software over comprehensive documentation.

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

Responding to change over following a plan.

Scrum is the most popular framework or methodology for implementing the Agile mindset. It's a structured approach to getting work done in an iterative way.

Key Scrum Concepts:

Sprint: A short, time-boxed period (usually 1-4 weeks) during which the team works to complete a set amount of work.

Product Backlog: A prioritized list of all features, enhancements, and fixes desired for the product.

Sprint Backlog: A subset of items from the Product Backlog selected for a specific Sprint.

Daily Stand-up (or Daily Scrum): A short daily meeting for the team to sync up on progress and impediments.

Sprint Review: A meeting at the end of a Sprint to demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders.

Sprint Retrospective: A meeting for the team to reflect on the past Sprint and identify areas for improvement.

Day 3: Project Management with Jira (August 10, 2025)
Jira is a powerful software tool developed by Atlassian that is widely used by Agile teams to plan, track, and manage their work.

1. The Product Backlog in Jira
In Jira, the backlog is a dedicated space where the team's work items are listed. These items are often called "Issues."

Issue Types in Jira:

Epic: A large body of work that can be broken down into smaller stories. (e.g., "User Authentication").

Story: A user-centric feature requirement. (e.g., "As a user, I want to be able to log in with my email and password").

Task: A specific technical action item. (e.g., "Set up the login database table").

Bug: A problem or defect in the software.

The Product Owner is typically responsible for prioritizing the backlog by dragging and dropping issues, ensuring the team works on the most valuable items first.

2. The Scrum Board in Jira
The Scrum board (or Kanban board) is a visual representation of the team's workflow. It helps everyone see the status of every item in the current Sprint.

Typical Columns on a Scrum Board:

To Do: Items from the Sprint Backlog that have not been started.

In Progress: Items that are actively being worked on.

In Review / In QA: Work that is complete from a development perspective and is now being tested or reviewed.

Done: Work that is 100% complete and meets the team's "Definition of Done."

Work moves from left to right across the board as it progresses through the workflow. This provides transparency and helps identify bottlenecks.

End of Week 1. You now have a solid foundation in how software projects are structured and managed. Next week, we dive into the core technologies of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
